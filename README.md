## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

- `backend/`: Contains the core agent logic, tools, memory management, and authentication handling.
- `frontend/`: Contains the user interface application.

Key files include:

- [`backend/agent_graph.py`](backend/agent_graph.py):  defines the agent's workflow or state machine.
- [`backend/calendar_tools.py`](backend/calendar_tools.py): Contains tools for interacting with calendar services.
- [`backend/main.py`](backend/main.py): The main entry point for the backend application.
- [`backend/oauth.py`](backend/oauth.py): Handles OAuth authentication flows.
- [`frontend/app.py`](frontend/app.py): The main entry point for the frontend application.

## Setup and Running Locally

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd attempt
    ```

2.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project. This file should contain your `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

    ```env
    GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
    ```
    Credentials JSON: A JSON file containing your Google Cloud credentials must be placed inside the `env` folder in the root directory. This is necessary for services requiring GCP authentication.

3.  **Set up Google Cloud Credentials:**
    Download your Google Cloud credentials JSON file from the Google Cloud Platform console. Place this JSON file inside a folder named `.env` in the root directory of the project. The name of the JSON file typically starts with `credentials`.

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the `backend` and `frontend` directories and install the required dependencies using pip:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cd ../frontend
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cd ..
    ```

5.  **Run the Backend:**
    uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    ```

6.  **Run the Frontend:**
    streamlit run frontend/app.py --server.address 0.0.0.0 --server.port 8501
    ```

The application should now be running locally. Refer to the specific backend and frontend code for default ports and access details.

## Environment Variables and Credentials

-   `.env`: Located in the root directory, this file is used to store environment-specific variables like API keys. It must contain `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
-   Credentials JSON: A JSON file containing your Google Cloud credentials must be placed inside the `env` folder in the root directory. This is necessary for services requiring GCP authentication.
